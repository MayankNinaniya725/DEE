    print("\n📋 ISSUE ANALYSIS:")
    print("1. ❌ PDF Text Extraction: 0 characters extracted by pdfplumber")
    print("2. ❌ OCR Quality: Table content not properly recognized")
    print("3. ❌ Missing Data: Expected part numbers (6-0003, 6-0002) not in OCR")
    print("4. ⚠️  Pattern Error: 'NoneType' strip() error during processing")
    print("5. ✅ Certificate: Successfully extracting HR20230608013")
    
    print("\n🔍 ROOT CAUSES:")
    print("• The PDF appears to be a scanned image with poor OCR quality")
    print("• The table structure is not being recognized by OCR")
    print("• The document may be different from the certificate image shown earlier")
    print("• Possible encoding/corruption issues in the PDF file")
    
    print("\n💡 IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS:")
    
    print("\n1️⃣  Update Certificate Pattern (COMPLETED):")
    print("   ✅ Now extracting: HR20230608013")
    print("   ✅ Pattern: \\b(HR\\d{11})\\b")
    
    print("\n2️⃣  Fix Pattern Processing Error:")
    print("   Need to handle None values in pattern extraction")
    
    print("\n3️⃣  Alternative Extraction Strategy:")
    print("   Since table content is not OCR'd properly:")
    print("   • Extract available data (certificate number)")
    print("   • Generate placeholder entries with known part numbers")
    print("   • Flag entries as 'OCR_INCOMPLETE' for manual review")
    
    print("\n4️⃣  Document Quality Solutions:")
    print("   • Use document preprocessing (rotation, contrast adjustment)")
    print("   • Try different OCR engines (Tesseract with better settings)")
    print("   • Manual data entry for problematic documents")
    
    print("\n📊 CURRENT EXTRACTION STATUS:")
    print("   📜 Certificate No.: ✅ Working (HR20230608013)")
    print("   🔥 Heat No.: ❌ Not found in OCR")  
    print("   📋 Part Numbers: ❌ Not found in OCR")
    print("   🎯 Expected Entries: 2 (6-0003, 6-0002)")
    print("   ❌ Actual Entries: 0 (due to processing error)")
    
    print("\n🚀 RECOMMENDED ACTION PLAN:")
    print("1. Fix the pattern processing error")
    print("2. Extract what's available (certificate number)")
    print("3. Create manual fallback for missing part numbers")
    print("4. Flag document for quality review")
    print("5. Consider document preprocessing pipeline")
    
    print("\n⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTE:")
    print("The PDF file may not contain the expected table data")
    print("or the OCR quality is insufficient for automated extraction.")
